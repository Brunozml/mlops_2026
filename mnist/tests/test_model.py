"""
Docstring for tests.test_model. 

 Checks  that for a given input with shape X that the output of the model has shape Y.

When you implement a test you need to follow two standards
for pytest to be able to find your tests. 
First, any files created (except __init__.py) should always start with test_*.py.
Secondly, any test implemented needs to be wrapped into a function that again needs to start with test_*:
